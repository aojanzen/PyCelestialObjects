Not sure how this project will end. It is inspired by go-to telescope mounts
and various maker projects on the internet. First goal was to calculate the
positions of deep sky objects (DSOs) from publicly available catalogues and
convert the positions in the sky from the universal right ascension/declination
to altitude/azimuth angles. While the former are commonly used for equatorial
mounts, the latter are the natural coordinates to be used with alt/az and
Dobsonian mounts.

Current status:
* List of 48 brightest stars in the night sky created from Hipparcos catalogue
  and the "Yale Bright Star Atlas"
* List of DSOs created from the NGC 2000.0 catalogue downloaded from the NASA
  website
* Conversion from RA/decl to alt/az implemented based on a website that I need
  to find again
* Procedure for optimal alignment using rotary encoders for alitude and azimuth
  axes is in progress
